# TDI-ESG-Financial-Performance-Analysis
Excel Capstone Project analyzing the relationship between ESG metrics and financial performance for strategic investment insights. Built for TDI’s Data Immersed Bootcamp.

### Project Overview

This project analyzes how ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) performance relates to financial metrics like profit margin, revenue, and carbon emissions across industries from 2015 to 2025. It was done in Excel using pivot tables and dashboards to uncover trends and insights for sustainable business decisions.

### Data Sources

The dataset was provided by The Data Immersed (TDI) Community for the Excel Capstone Project. It includes ESG and financial performance data for 1,000 companies across multiple industries, covering the period from 2015 to 2025.

ESG & Financial Performance Data:

### Tools

- Excel - Data Cleaning, Data Analysis & Data Visualization

### Data Cleaning

1. Checked for and confirmed no duplicate records in the dataset.
2. Filtered each column to identify missing values.
3. Only the Growth Rate column had missing values — 1,000 rows, all from 2015, the base year.
4. Replaced missing growth rates with 0, assuming no prior data meant no growth.
5. Created two new columns:
    - ESG Category – classified ESG scores as Low, Moderate, or High.
    - Growth Rate Category – grouped growth rates into Negative, Neutral, or Positive.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. Which industries demonstrate the highest and lowest average ESG scores?
2. Is there a correlation between ESG scores and profit margins?
3. Which industries generate the highest average revenue annually?
4. How have ESG scores changed over time?
5. Which companies are carbon emission outliers within their industries?
